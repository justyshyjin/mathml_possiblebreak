While free flow of data is a primary requirement for digitisation of industry, it poses significant challenges in terms of data security, which cannot be solved easily because the factory of the future must exchange digital information with the outside world just like raw materials and components. There is a need to develop practically usable solutions which can guarantee an adequate level of security without limiting the capability to exchange data and information both on the manufacturing floor and beyond the factory.

Equipment interacts with each other and systems outside the company without intervention, and often without our knowledge. This creates a significant security challenge — any node on a manufacturer’s network could be an attack vector for the entire production system.

And unless you're an information technology professional specifically working in network security, you may think there's not much you can do to help. But this is only a limited view of cybersecurity. Since about 2010, information now has the potential to damage or destroy physical assets, and this can have significant impacts for production systems and supply chain resilience. This webinar will introduce you to cybersecurity and its relationship to quality systems, and explain tools like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder that you can start using now.

Lawyers, radiologists and software designers, among others, have seen their work evaporate to India or China. Tasks that would seem to require a distinctively human capacity for nuance are increasingly assigned to algorithms, like the ones currently being introduced to grade essays on college exams. Particularly terrifying to me, computer programs can now write clear, publishable articles, and, as Ford reports, Wired magazine quotes an expert’s prediction that within about a decade 90 percent of news articles will be computer-­generated.In his new book, Rise of the Robots, Ford considers the social and economic disruption that is likely to result when educated workers can no longer find employment.

In the past robots have been isolated from human contact in industrial environments with physical guarding and locked access. That is all changing at a rapid pace. Robots that collaborate with people are being developed and deployed at an increasing pace. The combination of humans collaborating with robots adds a new variable to the safety equation.

Miss Charlotte, as the line crew calls their robot, is still in use mounting sound insulation to doors, but many things have changed since. Today, over 40 lightweight robots are in use at the BMW Group plants; a total of 60 will be in operation by mid-year. They assume tasks that would be physically strenuous for workers and often pose particular challenges due to the high level of precision required and the repetitiveness involved.
